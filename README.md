# Bicausal Wasserstein Martingale Projection
The Bi-causal Wasserstein Martingale projection is a novel method for multi-dimensional martingale tests on data couplings. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first **consistent** test for the high-dimensional regime.

# Abstract
Given a collection of multidimensional pairs $\{(X_i,Y_i)\}_{1 \leq i\leq n}$, we study the problem of projecting the associated suitably smoothed empirical measure onto the space of martingale couplings (i.e. distributions satisfying $\mathbb{E}[Y|X]=X$) using the adapted Wasserstein distance. We call the resulting distance the *smoothed empirical martingale projection distance* (SE-MPD), for which we obtain an explicit characterization. We also show that the space of martingale couplings remains invariant under the smoothing operation. We study the asymptotic limit of the SE-MPD, which converges at a parametric rate as the sample size increases if the pairs are either i.i.d.~or satisfy appropriate mixing assumptions. Additional finite-sample results are also investigated. Using these results, we introduce a novel consistent martingale coupling hypothesis test, which we apply to test the existence of arbitrage opportunities in recently introduced neural network-based generative models for asset pricing calibration.
